# Creator Search Setup Guide

The creator search functionality has been successfully integrated into your frontend application! This feature uses AI (Gemini) to find relevant content creators and enriches the results with real YouTube data.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Search**: Uses Google's Gemini AI to find creators based on natural language queries
- **YouTube Integration**: Enriches creator profiles with real YouTube statistics and thumbnails
- **Hybrid Data Sources**: Combines AI suggestions with real-time YouTube data for comprehensive profiles
- **Smart Fallbacks**: Works even without YouTube API key (Gemini-only mode)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory with the following variables:

```env
# Gemini AI API Key (Required for creator search)
# Get your API key from: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# YouTube Data API Key (Optional but recommended for richer creator profiles)
# Get your API key from: https://console.developers.google.com/
VITE_YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key_here
```

### 2. Getting API Keys

#### Gemini API Key (Required)
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the generated key and add it to your `.env` file

#### YouTube Data API Key (Optional but Recommended)
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the "YouTube Data API v3"
4. Go to "Credentials" and create an API key
5. Copy the key and add it to your `.env` file

### 3. Usage

The creator search is already integrated into your Creator Database page:

1. Navigate to `/creators` in your application
2. Click the "Search Creators" button
3. Enter natural language queries like:
   - "Tech reviewers on YouTube"
   - "Travel vloggers in Japan"
   - "Fitness influencers under 100K subscribers"
4. View AI-powered results with real YouTube data

## How It Works

1. **AI Search**: Gemini AI analyzes your query and suggests relevant creators
2. **YouTube Lookup**: For each suggested creator, the system attempts to find their YouTube channel
3. **Data Enrichment**: Real YouTube statistics (subscribers, views, videos) are added to the profiles
4. **Fallback Handling**: If YouTube data isn't available, Gemini estimates are used

## Data Sources

- **Hybrid (YouTube primary)**: Creator found by AI and enriched with real YouTube data
- **Gemini (YouTube lookup failed)**: Creator found by AI but YouTube data unavailable
- **Gemini**: Creator found by AI (YouTube API not configured)

## Example Searches

- "Gaming streamers on Twitch and YouTube"
- "Food bloggers with high engagement rates"
- "Educational content creators in science"
- "Beauty influencers under 500K followers"
- "Tech reviewers who cover smartphones"

## Troubleshooting

### No Results Found
- Try more specific or different search terms
- Check that your Gemini API key is correctly configured
- Ensure you have internet connectivity

### Limited Data
- Configure YouTube API key for richer profiles
- Some creators may not have public YouTube channels

### API Errors
- Check that your API keys are valid and not expired
- Ensure you haven't exceeded API quotas
- Verify environment variables are properly set
