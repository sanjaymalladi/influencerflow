## [v2.4.0] - System Stability and Bug Fixes - 2024-07-26

### Fixed
- **Module Compatibility**: Resolved all ES6/CommonJS module compatibility issues that were causing server startup failures and runtime errors.
- **Contract Generation**: Fixed a critical bug in the `ContractManagerService` that was preventing PDF contracts from being generated correctly. Replaced the faulty implementation with the existing, stable `contractService`.

### Technical Implementation
- **Dependency Management**: Ensured all backend modules use CommonJS `require` and `module.exports` syntax for consistency.
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling and logging in several key services to make future debugging easier.

## [v2.0.0] - AI-Native Refactor - 2024-07-25

### Added
- **AI Agent Architecture (`CrewAI`)**: Introduced a new backend architecture centered around AI agents using the CrewAI framework. This moves the application from a traditional UI-driven model to a conversational, NLP-first platform.
- **Campaign Analyst Agent**: An AI agent responsible for reading and parsing campaign briefs from uploaded documents.
- **Creator Scout Agent**: An AI agent responsible for searching the creator database based on the parsed brief.
- **File Reader Tool**: A new tool for AI agents to read data from the filesystem, enabling the processing of uploaded campaign briefs.
- **Creator DB Search Tool**: A new tool for AI agents to interface with the creator database, enabling natural language queries for creator discovery.

### Changed
- **Core Application Focus**: Shifted the primary user interaction model from a manual, multi-step UI process to a single-prompt, agent-driven workflow. The user can now initiate a campaign by simply uploading a brief.
- **Backend Entrypoint**: The backend will be refactored to support kicking off the new AI crew from an API endpoint (e.g., `POST /api/campaigns/start`).
- **Backend Dependencies**: Added `crewai` and `langchain` to `package.json`. Switched to ES Module system (`"type": "module"`) to support modern libraries.

### Deprecated
- **Complex UI Workflows**: The previous emphasis on building out complex UIs for each step (search, outreach, negotiation) is deprecated in favor of a minimal, conversational interface that shows the AI's progress.

### Known Issues
- ~~**Blocked Backend**: The backend implementation is currently blocked by a persistent `npm install` issue, preventing the AI Crew from being run. The local Node.js environment needs to be fixed before backend work can resume.~~ ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Used existing dependencies to implement real AI workflow.
