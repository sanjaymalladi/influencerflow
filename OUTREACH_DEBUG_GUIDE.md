## How to Test the Fixes

### Step 1: Access the Debug Panel
1. Navigate to `/outreach` in your app
2. Click on the "Debug" tab (new tab added)
3. You'll see the Email Debug Panel with comprehensive testing tools

### Step 2: Test Dashboard Refresh
1. **Send a new email**:

   - Verify timestamp updates and data loads

### Step 3: Test Reply Functionality

#### Option A: Using Debug Panel (Recommended)

### Step 4: Test Pipeline View Updates
1. Go to "Pipeline" tab
2. Click "Refresh Pipeline" button (new button added)

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Email not found" when simulating reply
**Solution**: Make sure you've sent at least one email first. Only sent emails can receive replies.

### Issue: Dashboard shows old data
**Solution**: Use the "Refresh All Data" button in Debug tab, or check browser console for API errors.

### Issue: Status updates don't persist
**Solution**: Check if you're using mock emails (IDs starting with "email-") - these updates are stored in memory only.

### Issue: Pipeline doesn't show emails
**Solution**: Ensure emails exist and have proper status. Use Debug tab to verify data is loading correctly.
